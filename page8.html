<h3> Story</h3>

<br>
<li> During the preclassic period of the Mayan civilization, lived an indigenous clan of people by the name of Tzot. They were incredibly highly developed in their writing, mathematics, architecture, and astronomical systems. Much of their admirable lifestyle was given to them by the rain god Chaac who required that the Mayan people sacrifice objects and human beings into the sacred cenote (sacred well). The esoteric wells abounded with various artifacts such as gold, jade, incense, and human remains. As long as the rain god was satisfied, the people had food, water, and knowledge. However, one day, Chaac was not pleased with the number of offerings that were given to him. He bestowed his wrath against the Mayan people. They were left with no rain for days and their crops had withered entirely. A young Mayan shaman by the name of Aapo decided to seek help from the moon goddess Ix Chel, who was equally if not more powerful than the rain god Chaac. She wielded major influence in fertility, and growth in human beings, vegetation, and crops. Aapo approached the young beautiful goddess and they both fell in love with each other. She agreed to help him. Soon the sky became dark and an eclipse appeared between the clouds. There was a war between the rain god and the moon goddess. Each attacked with magic. Ix Chel was winning the battle, but then Chaac aimed his attack towards Aapo. She launched herself to save him and in that instant, she was hit and dropped her moonlit jaded hairpin to the ground. She was sent to the sky. Chaac had returned her to the moon. Aapo was not killed and instead was transformed into a creature not native to the land- a wolf. In the distance, ships could be seen. The Spaniards had arrived and had brought new beliefs. The once-powerful Chaac god had lost position in his reign towards the highly intellectual Mayan people. He disappeared into the sky to never appear again. The Spaniards conquered and threw away and changed the indigenous polytheistic views, ideas, and objects. Hence, this became the start of the decline of the advanced civilization. Many sacred objects were thrown into the sacred cenotes and amongst them remained the ancient mysterious hairpin that belonged to the moon goddess. Several years later, however, archaeological exploration removed various treasures including that of the hairpin. It is said that when the moon reaches its full peak, the lonely wolf can be heard crying for a love it will never touch.
