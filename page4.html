<li> For our group project, we decided to do a Monster Mash. Each person chose five monsters that are known in their culture. Since I come from a Mexican background, I decided to choose the very well known Chupacabras, La llorona, El duende,El Cucuy, and Siguanaba. The goal of the project was to combine the pieces to create a new monster. Thus we would be able to combine monsters known in our cultures. We also added red boxes with a black strip line to place the monsters inside. The reason we chose red is because its a common color for each of our cultures flags. Each box is considered a mystery pack.   </P>
<li> My pieces are in green wood with a few in clear acrylic</li>
